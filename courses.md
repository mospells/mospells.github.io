# Teaching in the Archives

## ["'Gayborhood' Histories,"](https://summer.jhu.edu/courses/public_fileDownloadIntersession.asp?path=1929.pdf) January 2018.
The second iteration of this class, we will be working with the unprocessed organizational archives of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Community Center of Baltimore, held at the University of Baltimore. Students researched the different sites for the Baltimore Pride Festival since the 1970s as a way of thinking about the queering of urban spaces. Working with [Timeline JS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/), we will document the different sites for the Baltimore Pride Festival since the 1970s. We will also be contributing more LGBTQ stories to the [Explore Baltimore Heritage website.](https://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/).

## "Displacement: From Urban Renewal to Gentrification," Fall 2017.
This course worked with the [Baltimore City Archives](https://baltimorecityhistory.net/) to create an online [Omeka](http://www.omeka.net/) exhibit about Baltimore neighborhoods that were acquired by the Housing Authority of Baltimore City and razed between 1938 and 1941. When we are ready to make the website public, the link will be added here.
