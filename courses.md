# Teaching in the Archives

## "Displacement: From Urban Renewal to Gentrification," Fall 2017.
This course worked with the [Baltimore City Archives](https://baltimorecityhistory.net/) to create an online [Omeka](http://www.omeka.net/) exhibit about Baltimore neighborhoods that were acquired by the Housing Authority of Baltimore City and razed between 1938 and 1941. When we are ready to make the website public, the link will be added here.

## "'Gayborhood' Histories," January 2017.
This was the first class to work with the archives of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Community Center of Baltimore, held at the University of Baltimore.  [Check out this feature on the class on the UB Special Collections Blog.](http://langsdalelibrary.blogspot.com/2017/02/a-beautiful-day-in-gayborhood.html)
