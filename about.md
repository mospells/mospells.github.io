# About Me



I am a historian of American politics, housing, and racism. My dissertation, [*Reckoning with Redlines*]({% link research.md %}), is a history of resident efforts to negotiate lending discrimination in St. Louis from 1954-1978 and draws on cultural studies, political economy, human geography, and digital humanities.
